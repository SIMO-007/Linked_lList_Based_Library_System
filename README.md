Yes, this system's database is entirely made of linked lists, i know there are other easier options i could've base the system around, but this was just a coding challenge for me and i wanted to learn more about linked lists.

There is an english and a french version, and it's better to execute the .exe as admin to avoid any problems, if the file is executed normally the interface will look diffrent and you will have to refresh it by entering one of the options and then going back, it should fix any visual bugs.

For the time being, the database is temporary, so when u close the program, the DB created will be deleted. I'm planning to add a feature to save the DB if wanted .

Here's a graph demonstrating the structure and the flow of the program :
